## Learning Goals
- Practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships
- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
- Utilize advanced active record techniques to perform complex database queries
- Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code
- Design an Object Oriented Solution to a problem
- Practice algorithmic thinking
- Work in a group
- Use Pull Requests to collaborate among multiple partners

## Requirements
- must use Rails 5.2.x
- must use PostgreSQL
