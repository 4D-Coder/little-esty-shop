## Evaluation

This project evaluation will consist of two 15-20 minute presentations each followed by 10-15 minutes of instructor led Q&A. Project teams should break into pairs and each pair will present following the guidelines below:

### Part 1: Student Presentation

Please choose a single user story to present from start to finish. Include the following in the presentation:

- Choose a story that was especially difficult or tricky to implement  
- Read through the user story description on the card in the Github project board
- Demo the user story on Heroku, include both happy and sad paths and edge cases if applicable.
- Walk through the tests for the user story, including feature tests and any associated model/unit tests 
- Walk through the implementation of the user story including database schema, models, controllers, and views
- Because the team should collectively own all of the code in the project. All team members should participate in the presentation (even if they did not contribute code to this specific user story). 
- Slides are not required but encouraged as a way to supplement code sharing. 

### Part 2: Q&A

Students should be prepared to answer questions from the instructor surrounding the implementation of the user story focusing on the subject areas listed in the project rubric.
